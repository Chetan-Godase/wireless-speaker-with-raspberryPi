# wireless-speaker-with-raspberryPi  
#To start with the project, First preapare the raspberry Pi to setup.

Download the Raspbian Stretch in the SD card of Raspberry Pi and connect the raspberry to a screen.
Open SSH of Raspian, to connect the raspberry Pi 
To connect the network to raspbbery Pi. enter 

**network={  
ssid="your_wifi_name"  
psk="your_wifi_password"  
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  
}**  

##Some prerequisites:-  
  
BlueZ  
to install, enter  
**$sudo apt-get install bluez**  
  
PulseAudio  
  
**$sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-* **  
  
##Connecting RaspberryPi  
Now the raspberry Pi can connect to WiFi, but you still need the IP to SSH into it. To get IP Enter  
  
**$ sudo nmap -sN [gateway ip address]/24**  
  
This give IP address of all devices connected including Raspberry Pi's address  
  
Now, to connect it, Enter  
  
**$ssh pi@Raspberrypi_ip_address**  
  
Now open BlueZ app by,  
  
**$bluethoothct1**    

**$agent NoInputNoOutput**
(this initializes a agent which helps connect bluetooth without user intervention.)  
  
**$default-agent**  
(Setting the agent as default, so it doesn't have to connect everytime)  
  
**$discoverable on**  
(setting the device as discoverable)  
  
##This set's up the raspberry Pi to connect by other devices.  
  
##try connecting a device such as phone or laptop  
 Enter "no" when the raspian prompts up for authorization of the connecting device, create a connection by trusting the device by,  
**$trust [MAC address of device]  
$connect [MAC address of device]**  
  
##Now check if the device is registered in PulseAudio by,  
**$pactl list short**  
  
#Now we automate all the above process by writing scripts (file available above)   
  
##Finalizing all the process for everytime the raspberry Pi is turned on  
##to create a cron job we need to give the raspberry Pi the main file.  
  
**$crontab -e**  
  
**@sudo reboot python3 /home/"file_location"/Bluetooth-speaker-main.py**
